Buxton
======

Buxton is a security-enabled configuration management system. It features a
layered approach to configuration storage, with each layer containing an
arbitrary number of groups, each of which may contain key-value pairs.
Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is implemented at the group level and at the
key-value level.

Buxton provides a C library (libbuxton) for client applications to use.
Internally, buxton uses a daemon (buxtond) for processing client requests and
enforcing MAC. Also, a CLI (buxtonctl) is provided for interactive use and for
use in shell scripts.


Build dependencies
==================

- attr, to provide a required header file, xattr.h

- check, to build the unit tests

- gdbm, for key-value pair storage

- Linux kernel headers, for the inotify header

- systemd, for autodetection of service file locations, for socket activation
  of buxtond, and the initialization of the Smack virtual filesystem


Additional runtime dependencies
===============================

- Smack-enabled kernel, for MAC support
  * CONFIG_SECURITY_SMACK=y


Note: if running a kernel without Smack enabled, buxton can still be used for
configuration management, but MAC will not be enforced.
